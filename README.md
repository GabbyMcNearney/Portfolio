Welcome! 
  Please look around at the progress I have made throughout my data journey. 
  I have learned many things along the way, including data cleaning, how to create semantic model relationships and visualizations in Tableau and Power BI, advanced Excel formulas with pivot tables and charts, to data structures, SQL queries and working with relational databases.
  This portfolio includes different files from my certifications, projects, completed educational courses with coursework and my resume.
